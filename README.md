# Bike-Share-Navigate-Speedy-Success-Case_Study


 # 1. Introduction
 
This case study is the Capstone Project of Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate . In this case study I am working as a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago.

Cyclistic is a bike-share program that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, my team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From the insights, our team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

There are 3 pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as Casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

In order to answer the key business questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.


# 2. Ask


How do Annual members and Casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

The key stakeholders are:

Lily Moreno, the director of marketing and my manager.
Cyclistic executive team.

First the Cyclistic executive team must approve our recommendations, so they must be backed up with data insights and data visualizations.

Then from the insights of my analysis, my team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.



# 3. Prepare


a.The data I used is Cyclistic’s Historical Trip Data to analyze and identify trends.

b.The previous 12 months data from 2020 October 1 to 2021 September 30 is used for analysis.

c.The data is stored in CSV files. Each file contains one month data. Thus a total of 12 .csv files.

d.The data is structured data ie., Organised data.

e.The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate.

f.The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.

g.As this data is collected by a real bike sharing company in Chicago, there are no issues with bias or credibility. So its Reliable, Original, Current and Cited (as in ROCCC). I do not think its Comprehensive because this data lacks some information.

e.As of data Integrity, its Accurate, Consistent and Trustworthy.

# Limitations

 a.The data-privacy issues prohibit me from using riders’ personally identifiable information. This means that I won’t be able to connect pass purchases to credit card numbers to determine if casual riders live in the Cyclistic service area or if they have purchased multiple single passes.

b.The financial information such as each Ride Id ticket fare is not available.

c.If the personally identifiable information and financial information were available, I could have calculated whether the casual riders had spent more money than if they opt for taking annual memberships.

d.This data does not contain data about the use of reclining bikes, hand tricycles and cargo bikes. It is said that about 8% of total riders use assistive options.
